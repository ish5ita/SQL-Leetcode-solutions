Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.




# Write your MySQL query statement below
with cte as(
select email,id,ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by email order by id) as rownum from person)
delete from person where id in(select id from cte where rownum>1)
