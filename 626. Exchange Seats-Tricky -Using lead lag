Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.
 

Write an SQL query to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.





# Write your MySQL query statement below

with cte as (
select id,
lag(id, 1) over (order by id) as before1,
lead(id, 1) over (order by id) as after1,student
from seat )

select 
(CASE
WHEN mod (id ,2) = 0 THEN before1
ELSE
CASE
WHEN after1 is null then id else after1 end
END) as id,student
from cte order by id
