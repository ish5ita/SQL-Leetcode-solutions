Write an SQL query to report the nth highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no nth highest salary, the query should report null.
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(X INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE Y INT;
    SET Y=X-1; -- For offset variable
    RETURN (
        SELECT DISTINCT salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY salary DESC
        LIMIT 1
        OFFSET Y
    );
END
